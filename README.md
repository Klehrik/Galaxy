### Controls

LMB - Select planets, drag to select units  
RMB - Send selected units to location  
R - Reset  

- The two numbers on your home planet represent Metal and Plasma resources respectively.
- A planet is colonized if at least one of your ships is there and there are no enemy ships there (I think? I might be misremembering).
- You can change the simulation speed in the top right.
